## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- TypeScript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Css modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) - For styles
- [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) - As a cloud database
- [React beatiful dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd) - For the drag and drop feature
- [React hot toast](https://react-hot-toast.com/) - Simple library to make a toasts faster

### What I learned

This project helped me to understand how beneficial the TypeScript is. I saw the benefits while the built-in Next linter was throwing multiple errors (especially in places where i forgot to set the type ðŸ˜…).

I've also learned that the documentation is your best friend when it comes to typing all the custom variables from various dependencies.
For example the **result** parameter from react beatiful dnd has a specific architecture, but the documentation hasn't a one concrete type, so I'd to type on my own using at least some useful parts.
```ts
export type DragEndResult = {
    draggableId: string,
    type: string,
    reason: string,
    source: {
        droppableId: string,
        index: number
    },
    destination: DraggableLocation | null | undefined
}
```
Moreover, I'm now more used to **Static Site Generation mechanism** in the Next.js and how **API routes** work

### Continued development

My next step is to work a little more with Next and use more of its potential, and I'm think that the API countries will be a great playground for that.

### Useful resources

- [Egghead.io react-beatiful-dnd course](https://egghead.io/courses/beautiful-and-accessible-drag-and-drop-with-react-beautiful-dnd) - Great place to get started with this drag and drop library (even if it is written in class components)
